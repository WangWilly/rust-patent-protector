You should use`core::result::Result` when you need to represent the outcome of an operation that can either succeed or fail. This type is particularly useful in functions that may encounter errors and need to propagate them to the caller. Here are some scenarios where you would use `core::result::Result`:

1. **File I/O Operations**:
    When reading from or writing to a file, the operation might fail due to various reasons (e.g., file not found, permission denied).

    ```rust
    use std::fs::File;
    use std::io::{self, Read};

    fn read_file(path: &str) -> core::result::Result<String, io::Error> {
        let mut file = File::open(path)?;
        let mut contents = String::new();
        file.read_to_string(&mut contents)?;
        Ok(contents)
    }
    ```

2. **Network Requests**:
    When making network requests, the operation might fail due to network issues, invalid URLs, etc.

    ```rust
    use reqwest::Error;

    async fn fetch_url(url: &str) -> core::result::Result<String, Error> {
        let response = reqwest::get(url).await?;
        let body = response.text().await?;
        Ok(body)
    }
    ```

3. **Parsing Data**:
    When parsing data (e.g., JSON, XML), the operation might fail if the data is malformed.

    ```rust
    use serde_json::Error;

    fn parse_json(data: &str) -> core::result::Result<serde_json::Value, Error> {
        let parsed: serde_json::Value = serde_json::from_str(data)?;
        Ok(parsed)
    }
    ```

4. **Custom Error Handling**:
    When defining custom error types for your application, you can use [`core::result::Result`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fwillywangkaa%2FProjects%2Faxum-template%2Fsrc%2Ferror.rs%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A33%2C%22character%22%3A21%7D%7D%5D%2C%22545684d9-9c91-4e35-a074-d88550a2b056%22%5D "Go to definition") to handle these errors.

    ```rust
    #[derive(Debug)]
    enum MyError {
        NotFound,
        PermissionDenied,
        Unknown,
    }

    fn do_something() -> core::result::Result<(), MyError> {
        // Some operation that might fail
        Err(MyError::NotFound)
    }
    ```

In the provided code, `core::result::Result` is used to define a type alias for `Result<T, Error>`, which simplifies error handling throughout the application:

```rust
pub type Result<T> = core::result::Result<T, Error>;
```

This alias is used for operations that return an`Error` on failure, making the code more concise and easier to read.
